# CareerFoundry- Instacart
This is a repository for python code for my data analytics course achievement 4 Instacart Analysis.

### Achievement 4 Description
This repository is for Achievement 4 of my data analytics course.  For this achievement, I was a data analyst for instacart.  I performed an initial exploratory anlysis on some of Instacrt's public data to derive insights and suggest strategies.  I created a report to help Instacart better understand purchasing behaviors of their customers. 

### Data
For this analysis, I used open source data from Instacart 
###### orders
###### products
###### departments

### Tools
The following python libraries were used for this anlysis:
###### pandas-for data analysis
###### seaborn-for visualizations

### Code
The code for this analysis is available in the scripts folder of the instacart analysis
