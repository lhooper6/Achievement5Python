## Achievement 4 Description
This repository is for Achievement 4 of my data analytics course.  For this achievement, I was a data analyst for instacart.  I performed an initial exploratory anlysis on some of Instacrt's public data to derive insights and suggest strategies.  I created a report to help Instacart better understand purchasing behaviors of their customers.
